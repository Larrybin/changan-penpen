# Self-check Execution Report

This document captures the verification commands executed after integrating Upstash rate limiting. Network restrictions currently block fetching new npm packages, so runtime dependencies for `@upstash/ratelimit` and `@upstash/redis` are unavailable in the container.

## Commands

| Command | Result | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `pnpm check:all` | Failed | Type generation succeeded, but TypeScript cannot resolve the Upstash packages because they are not installed. |
| `pnpm test` | Passed with skips | Vitest completed 23 suites (1 skipped). Tests that require `better-sqlite3` continue to skip because native bindings are not present in this environment. |
| `pnpm build` | Failed | Next.js build stops with module resolution errors for `@upstash/ratelimit` and `@upstash/redis/cloudflare`. |

## Follow-up

Installing the missing dependencies requires npm registry access. Once connectivity is restored, run `pnpm install` followed by the above commands to confirm a clean build.
